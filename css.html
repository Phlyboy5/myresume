        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to creat
         high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne
          Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives
           programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

        Benefits: Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple 
        syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits,and integration with other popular programming languages
        such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. 
        “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” 
        It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.

Drawbacks: Python is not suitable for mobile application development.
